# SharePoint Column Formatting
The purpose of this repository is to store column formatting samples that can be used to customize fields in SharePoint lists and libraries. Although this is my personal GitHub repo, I will be contributing all my samples to the SharePoint team's <a href="https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-column-formatting">repo</a>.

If you are not familiar with the SharePoint Column Formatting, you can check out the official documentation <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/declarative-customization/column-formatting">here</a>. You can also check out all the samples available in GitHub <a href="https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-column-formatting/tree/master/samples">here</a>.
